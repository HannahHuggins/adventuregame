**Ideas for game**
--
**Save and load**

* Implement save and load feature using pickle
* Need to be able to save and load at any time (means the game will have to be big enough to justify.)
* Save with input 's' and load with 'l'?
-------------
**Enemies**

* Create an enemy class and different subclasses.
* Use import random and randint etc to change chances of coming across certain enemies.
-------------
**Battles**

* Create a way of calculating damage and health etc. 
* Randomize battles.
-------------
**Items**

* Create a way of randomly picking up certain items, rarity etc.
* Different types of items, weapons, armor and health healing items.
-------------
**Story**

* Figure out a good story, make it a decentish length.
* Maybe try to map out directions and character progression etc 
------------
**Timer**

* Import a timer or some way of people able to see how long the player has been playing, items could be affected by this etc. 
* Maybe a way to pause the timer? 
------------
**Map**

* Need to create a list of stages and functions within a dictionary - easy to access and means i won't have to write new modules for each stage
